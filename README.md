# Mars-Rover

In this project, I created a MATLAB function that will serve as the “brains” for a robot that is traversing the surface of an alien planet. This robot has two missions. One is to search for water. The other is to find the highest ground possible in order to take panoramic photographs back to earth to help scientists survey the landscape.
